- to focus
  - your thoughts become more intentional
- to remember
- to study
  - have you ever borrowed somebody else's notes?
- to show interest
  - you need to remember what somebody is telling you

# Offline first

I can write and search my notes without internet connection

I need to take a note whenever... 
It has to be quick and with basic tools, or I get lost in formatting and the various options.

# Collaboration first

Google Docs and Notion are great for collaboration. Less for quick thinking.

# CRDT

[Conflict-free Replicated Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)

A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that simplifies distributed data storage systems and multi-user applications. In many systems, copies of some data need to be stored on multiple computers (known as replicas).

How would you implement the full text search? Remember it has to work offline too.

Orama? [SQLite](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)?
